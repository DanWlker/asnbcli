## READ FIRST

This is your reminder to not download code from the internet and run it willy nilly. 

I am not responsible for anything that happens if you use this code, PLEASE AUDIT THE CODE YOURSELF BEFORE USING IT.

As this is finance related, I WILL NEVER RELEASE A BINARY OF IT. 

You should NEVER use any distributed binaries that claim to be from this repo.

If you know how to run this, you know how to run this.

## DISCLAIMER

I am in no way affiliated with Asnb, I am just frustruated that I have to stay up to 2 in the morning to buy these funds.
All code and requests used in this repo can be retrieved from publically available sources. Lastly, thank you Asnb I love you <3
